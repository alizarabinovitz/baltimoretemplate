<h3> Nature </h3>


<h4> There is a lot of nature in the world. In the woods and just around the world in genaral. But some people don't treat nature like it should be treated and some people even try to hurt nature. I know there is a lot of things that can hurt nature but there are ways we can make it better for example:
  <ul>
  <li> not cuting trees down
  <li> not posioning trees or flowers that are not already posioned 
<li> picking flowers on the bushes
<li> pelling bark off of trees
  </ul>
  <h4> Some people might think some of this stuff doesn't hurt the trees and flowers but it does. For example peeling bark off trees is like pulling hair off of someones head. Here is a picture of a tree being watered and cared for:
